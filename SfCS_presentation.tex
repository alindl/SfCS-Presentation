	\begin{itemize}
        \pause{}
		\item Human Building Interaction (HBI) focuses on resources and therefore on budgeting
		\pause{}
		\item Goal is to end the talk about whether resources are (in) finite
		\pause{}
		\item Scarcity of resources (whether artificial or not) has an impact on the design
		\pause{}
		\item Just because something is not scarce, no overusage is recommended (eg. WiFi and routers)
	\end{itemize}

		\item Intelligent walls: optimize bandwith usage
